# FreeCodeCamp: Quote Machine

This is my solution to the FreeCodeCamp "[Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)" challenge.

- This project uses React's "class component" methodology instead of "functional component" methodology. Using class components was decided for instructional purposes.
- This exercise was to help teach myself how React works, and how to write React code using class components.

## To Run

1. Clone down the repository.
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
4. Once the project starts, the app should open in the browser.
